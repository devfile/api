# Note:
#
# The command Id are merged *per-event type*
# from the commands of the corresponding event type
# in parent, plugins and devfile main content.
#
# The command Ids in each event type are string slices.
# While merging original insertion order of events would
# be preserved.
#
# However in the test results, as it will happen usually,
# command ids of a given event type will be merged preserving
# insertion order in source devfiles.
