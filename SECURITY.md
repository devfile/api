# Reporting of Security Issues

The devfiles team takes immediate action to address security-related issues involving devfile projects.

Note, that normally we try to fix issues found for the latest releases of our projects. Backport fixes will be made only for exceptional cases, if the team has identified the need to do so.

## Reporting Process

When a security vulnerability is found, it is important to not accidentally broadcast publicly that the issue exists to avoid potential exploits. The preferred way of reporting security issues in Devfiles is listed below.

## Contact Us

An email to <a href="mailto:team-devfile-security@redhat.com">team-devfile-security@redhat.com</a> is the preferred mechanism for outside users to report security issues. A member of the devfile team will open the required issues and keep you up-to-date about the status of the issue.

## What To Avoid

Do not open a public issue, send a pull request, or disclose any information about the suspected vulnerability publicly, **including in your own publicly visible git repository**.
