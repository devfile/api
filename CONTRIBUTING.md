### Prerequisites

The following are required to build the CRDs and TypeScript models containing your changes:

- Docker or Podman
- Git

Testing requires Go 1.21+ to be installed.

### Building

To build the CRD and the various schemas, you don't need to install any pre-requisite apart from `docker` or `podman`.
In the root directory, if you are using `podman` first run `export USE_PODMAN=true`. Then for either `docker` or `podman` run the following command:

```console
bash ./docker-run.sh ./build.sh
```

### Typescript model

Typescript model is generated based on JSON Schema with help of <https://github.com/kubernetes-client/gen>.
To generate them locally run:

```console
bash ./build/typescript-model/generate.sh
```

### Testing

Find more information about tests in the [testing document](test/README.md).

```console
# schemaTest approach
cd test/v200/schemaTest
go test -v
```

```console
# apiTest approach
cd test/v200/apiTest
go test -v
```
